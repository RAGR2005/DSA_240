Approach:  We maintain a variable count that keeps a track of the number of consecutive 1’s while traversing the array. The other variable max_count maintains the maximum number of 1’s, in other words, it maintains the answer.

We start traversing from the beginning of the array. Since we can encounter either a 1 or 0 there can be two situations:-

If  the value at the current index is equal to 1 we increase the value of count by one. After updating  the count variable if it becomes more than the max_count  update the max_count.
If the value at the current index is equal to zero we make the variable count as 0 since there are no more consecutive ones.

Time Complexity: O(N) since the solution involves only a single pass
Space Complexity: O(1) because no extra space is used.
