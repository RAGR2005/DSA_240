/*
Optimized Approach--

Approach: 
Here, in the given array :
n = 5,
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
At first, we have to shift the array towards the left so, we store the value of the first index in a variable (let it be x).
Then we iterate the array from the 0th index to the n-1th index(why n-1 i will explain it below)
And then store the value present in the next index to the current index like this :
arr[i] = arr[i+1]
And to prevent its segmentation fault we will iterate it till n-1.
At last, put the value of variable x in the last index of the array.


Time Complexity: O(n), as we iterate through the array only once.
Space Complexity: O(1) as no extra space is used


void solve(int arr[], int n) {
  int temp = arr[0]; // storing the first element of array in a variable
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
  }
  arr[n - 1] = temp; // assigned the value of variable at the last index
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << arr[i] << " ";
  }

}
int main() {
  int n=5;
  
  int arr[]= {1,2,3,4,5};
  solve(arr, n);
}
